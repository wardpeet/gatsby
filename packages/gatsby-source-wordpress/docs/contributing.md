# Contributing to `gatsby-source-wordpress`

## Code Contributions

Refer to the [main Gatsby docs on code contributions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/contributing/setting-up-your-local-dev-environment/) to get started. The gist of it is that you'll run `gatsby-dev-cli` in one terminal window, which will copy changed files into your development Gatsby site, and in another terminal window you'll run `gatsby develop` to see your changes in action. Make sure you run `yarn bootstrap` in the root of this repo first, though.

### Writing and Running Tests

Refer to the docs on [how tests are run](./tests.md). Unit tests should be added to a `__tests__` directory in the directory of the file they're testing. Integration and e2e tests should be added to the `integration-tests` directory at the root of this repo.
